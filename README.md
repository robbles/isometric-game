Quick Description
=================
* Isometric (the pixel kind, not the mathematical one)
* Infinite world, divided into "sectors"
* Sectors are divided into "blocks", which have their own type, sprite, etc.
* Some blocks block the player, some don't (e.g. walls vs floors)
* The player is a little tank thingie
* You can gather resources from sectors, build weapons (bombs!) and use them to blow up other sectors
* I might make multiple floors and staircases to transition between them. we'll see.

Actually Implemented (As of Dec. 2)
===================================
* Basic isometric demo of one sector
* Simple floor and block tiles
